## Week0 Sep 25<sup>th</sup>-Oct 2<sup>nd</sup>

### Tuesday 25<sup>th</sup>

Taken By: David N. Zilio

* With little understanding of the game or requirements we decided it would be best if we focused exclusively on reviewing the rules and playing the game with cards. Which yielded the following questions.
  1. Can a Set have duplicates of the same card in it?\
    eg. In a set of four 4 tiles of each colour, could you add a 4 tile duplicating one of the colours?
      * No
  2. Do you have to play tiles if you can play tiles or can you choose to do nothing?
      * You can choose to do nothing, you do not have to play tiles.
  3. Can you play under 30pts at the begining of the game with a "locked" table space?
      * No.
  4. Can you take a joker on the table without replacing it if it's not required for the meld?
      * No Jokers - Irrelivant
* Decided Brittny would open the private Git Repo and invite everyone to it
* Brittney will be creating the base project in Eclipse as she is the only one using Eclipse and we figure it should create the best base project structure (other devs are all using VS-Code which "should" be adaptable)
* We will be building the project based on Aidan's BlackJack Assignment base which he is responcible for adding to the Git Repo

* Discussed the future of these meetings and what they should be.
  * Tuesdays: We figure most development would be done on Weekends so Tuesdays should be code review and sprint review
  * Thursdays: We extended the thoughts for Tuesdays to determine that Thursdays should be sued for design, backlog refinement and sprint commitments
* UML was put up on the board and Aidan assumed responsiblity for posting it in the readme to the Git

* David - Threading I guess... Controller's my problem
* Bree - UI
* Aidan - AI
* Ellis - Table/basic play mechanisms
* Observer Patterns?
* When merging: merge into master, then branch back out
* This meeting should be focused on planning so we can work independently without conflicting
* We ended up spening a lot of time focusing on ideas of what we should do going forward and extending the UML design
* We were stumped with how to properly abstract an observer pattern while following the semantics of MVC
