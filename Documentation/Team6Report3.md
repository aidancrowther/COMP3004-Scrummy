__Work Completed:__

1. What did you commit to?
    * Nothing, I had lost touch with the state of the project
2. Did you meet your commitments?
    * Yes, but those commitments were nothing
3. Notes:
    * Mon Oct 29<sup>th</sup>
        * Group is insisting that I'm going to be hit with the non-contributor's penalty... I'm concerned I don't want that and I have time to work on the code now on this week. I'm working on it tonight.
        * scraping the code it still doesn't execute and actually do anything it's just a bunch of modules. (I fixed that)
        * I worked heavily on the UML design early and I expect that as part of the overall picture coming together in my head I'm going to have to build the main game, stitching the pieces together
        * Poor oop practice all over the place and my group is arguing that it's because of tdd. I don't believe that JP actually wants this. Specifically the code is using the wrong access modifiers; everything is public so even helper functions can be tested with tdd.
        * Debugged some and got the game running with actual hands being displayed

__Plans until Due Date:__

* Get the game running nicer
* ensure that funcitonality is as desired and we're meeting all criteria of the marking scheme
