## Week 0 Sep 25<sup>th</sup> - Oct 2<sup>nd</sup>

1. What did you commit to?
    * No Commitments this week - technically the project hasn't started.
2. Did you meet your commitments?
    * N/A
3. Notes:
    * Sun 30th
      1. We're getting organized this week. Even though we have no commitments and few delegated jobs (or none in my case).
      2. I'm setting up the base for our development documentation as well as our meeting minutes which I failed to record effectively in meeting this past week.
      3. I'm gonna take a look through the code base and I'll update this if I do any dev there.

## Week 1 Oct 2<sup>nd</sup> - Oct 9<sup>th</sup>

1. What did you commit to?
    * Commited to development towards the controller and general code abstraction/design
2. Did you meet your commitments?
    * Fixed the larger problem from the meeting with controller-UI observer design
    * ??Development/implementation on controller & UI??
3. Notes:
    * Tue Oct 2<sup>nd</sup>
      1. After our meeting, Jason (friend) and I were discussing the OO-design of the controller and came up with linking the AI into the UserInterface interface so that the AI Strategies could be interfaced exactly like users.
      2. I discussed the above with the group and was assigned UML alterations. Given, my idea becomes my work - makes sence
      3. UML is updated. ReNamed a number of classes and began making empty classes in java files so that the team can get working without worries of conflicts with file names

## Week 2 Oct 9<sup>th</sup> - Oct 16<sup>th</sup>

1. What did you commit to?
    * Not really much, It's a really busy week for me
2. Did you meet your commitments?
    * considering their sad state, yes
3. Notes:
    * Tue Oct 16<sup>th</sup>
      1. Took down the project and tried to build realizing a couple of bugs, reported them and I'm considering fixing them.

## Week 3 Oct 16<sup>th</sup> - Oct 30<sup>th</sup>

1. What did you commit to?
    * Nothing, I had lost touch with the state of the project
2. Did you meet your commitments?
    * Yes, but those commitments were nothing
3. Notes:
    * Mon Oct 29<sup>th</sup>
        * Group is insisting that I'm going to be hit with the non-contributor's penalty... I'm concerned I don't want that and I have time to work on the code now on this week. I'm working on it tonight.
        * scraping the code it still doesn't execute and actually do anything it's just a bunch of modules. (I fixed that)
        * I worked heavily on the UML design early and I expect that as part of the overall picture coming together in my head I'm going to have to build the main game, stitching the pieces together
        * Poor oop practice all over the place and my group is arguing that it's because of tdd. I don't believe that JP actually wants this. Specifically the code is using the wrong access modifiers; everything is public so even helper functions can be tested with tdd.
        * Debugged some and got the game running with actual hands being displayed
