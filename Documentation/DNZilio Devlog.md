      1. We're getting organized this week. Even though we have no commitments and few delegated jobs (or none in my case).
      2. I'm setting up the base for our development documentation as well as our meeting minutes which I failed to record effectively in meeting this past week.
      3. I'm gonna take a look through the code base and I'll update this if I do any dev there.

## Week 1 Oct 2<sup>nd</sup> - Oct 9<sup>th</sup>

1. What did you commit to?
    * Commited to development towards the controller and general code abstraction/design
2. Did you meet your commitments?
    * Fixed the larger problem from the meeting with controller-UI observer design
    * ??Development/implementation on controller & UI??
3. Notes:
    * Tue Oct 2<sup>nd</sup>
      1. After our meeting, Jason (friend) and I were discussing the OO-design of the controller and came up with linking the AI into the UserInterface interface so that the AI Strategies could be interfaced exactly like users.
      2. I discussed the above with the group and was assigned UML alterations. Given, my idea becomes my work - makes sence
      3. UML is updated. ReNamed a number of classes and began making empty classes in java files so that the team can get working without worries of conflicts with file names
