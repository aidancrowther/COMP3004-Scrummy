      1. We're getting organized this week. Even though we have no commitments and few delegated jobs (or none in my case).
      2. I'm setting up the base for our development documentation as well as our meeting minutes which I failed to record effectively in meeting this past week.
      3. I'm gonna take a look through the code base and I'll update this if I do any dev there.
